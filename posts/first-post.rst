I am now since a little more than two years doing a PhD in Chemistry
with focus on radiation induced processes at the solid/water interface.

On this blog I hope to - if time permits - write about some of the
problems of more general interest (and their solution) popping up as I
am striving forward.

On a technical note, this blog is staticially generated using `Nikola
<http://www.getnikola.com/>`_ (EDIT 2016-07-27: It used to be Pelican).
The source for this site is hosted at `github <http://github.com/bjodah/bjodah.github.io/tree/source>`_.
