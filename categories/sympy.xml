year through the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/"&gt;Google Summer of Code&lt;/a&gt; project. The project allows
under- and post-graduate students around the world to apply to
mentoring organizations for a scholarship to work on a project during
the summer. This spring I made the leap, I wrote a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/GSoC-2017-Application-Bj%C3%B6rn-Dahlgren:-Improved-code-generation-facilities"&gt;proposal&lt;/a&gt; which
got accepted, and I am now working full time for the duration of this
summer on one of these projects. In this blog post I'll give some
background and tell you about the first project week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="background"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since a few years I've been contributing code to the open-source project
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.sympy.org"&gt;SymPy&lt;/a&gt;. SymPy is a so-called "computer algebra system",
which lets you manipulate mathematical expressions symbolically. I've used this
software package extensively in my own doctoral studies and it has been really useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My research involves formulating mathematical models to: rationalize experimental observations,
fit parameters or aid in design of experiments. Traditionally one sits down and derive equations,
often using pen &amp;amp; paper, then one writes computer code which implements said model, and finally
one writes a paper with the same formulas as LaTeX code (or something similar).
Note how this procedure involves writing the same equations essentially three times,
during derivation, coding and finally the article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using SymPy I can, from a single source:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do the derivations (fewer hard-to-find mistakes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate the numerical code (a blazing fast computer program)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output LaTeX formatted equations (pretty formulas for the report)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very attractive side-effect of this is that one truly get reproducible research
(reproducibility is one of the pillars in science). Every step of the process is
self-documented, and because SymPy is free software: &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; can redo them. I
can't stress enough how big this truly is. It is also the main
motivation why I haven't used proprietary software in place of SymPy,
even though that software may be considerably more feature complete
than SymPy, any code I wrote for it would be inaccessible to people
without a license (possibly even including myself if I leave academia).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this work-flow to work in practice the capabilities of the computer algebra system
need to be quite extensive, and it is here my current project with SymPy comes in.
I have had several ideas on how to improve capability number two
listed above: generating the numerical code, and now I get the chance
to realize some of them and work with the community to improve SymPy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="first-week"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;First week&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of the first week has been spent on introducing type-awareness into
the code-printers. SymPy has printer-classes which specialize printing of e.g.
strings, C code, Fortran code etc. Up to now there has been no way to indicate
what precision the generated code should be for. The default floating point type
in python is for example "double precision" (i.e. 64-bit binary IEEE 754 floating
point). This is also the default precision targeted by the code
printers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are occasions where one want to use another
precision. For example, consumer class graphics cards which are
ubiquitous often have excellent single precision performance, but are
intentionally capped with respect to double precision arithmetic (due
to marketing reasons). At other times, one want just a bit of extra
precision and extended precision (80-bit floating point, usually the
data type of C's &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;long double&lt;/tt&gt;) is just what's needed to compute
some values with the required precision. In C, the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/c/numeric/math"&gt;corresponding math functions&lt;/a&gt; are standardized since
C99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have started the work to enable the code printers to print this in a
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/12693"&gt;pull-request&lt;/a&gt; to the
SymPy source repository. I have also started experimenting with a
class representing arrays. Arrays&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first weekly meeting with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://asmeurer.com"&gt;Aaron Meurer&lt;/a&gt; went well and we also briefly
discussed how to reach out to the SymPy community for wishes on what
code-generation functions to provide, I've set up a wiki-page for it
under the SymPy projects wiki:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/codegen-gsoc17"&gt;https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/codegen-gsoc17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be sending out an email to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sympy"&gt;mailing list for SymPy&lt;/a&gt; asking for feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also discussed the upcoming SciPy 2017 conference where Aaron
Meurer and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.moorepants.info/"&gt;Jason Moore&lt;/a&gt; will be giving
a tutorial on code-generation with SymPy. They've asked me to join
forces with them and I've happily accepted that offer and am looking
forward to working on the tutorial material and teaching fellow
developers and researchers in the scientific python community about
how to leverage SymPy for code generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next blog post will most likely be a bit more technical, but I thought
it was important to give some background on what motivates this effort
and what the goal is.&lt;/p&gt;
