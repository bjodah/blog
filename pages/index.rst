Bj√∂rn I. Dahlgren
=================
I'm currently a second year PhD student in the Department of Chemistry at `KTH Royal Institute of Technology <http://www.kth.se/en>`_. I work with `Mats Jonsson <http://www.kth.se/en/che/divisions/tfk/staff/seniors/jonsson-1.79948>`_ and `Tore Brinck <http://www.kth.se/en/che/divisions/tfk/staff/seniors/brinck-1.80061>`_ on interfacial radiation chemistry.

Research
--------
My research project at KTH
aims to develop better models for chemical processes at surfaces
between water and metals/metal oxides driven by ionizing radiation.
In the study of these phenomena I often need to test a model by
formulating it mathematically and solving it numerically using
a combination of own specially written software and standard numerical
libraries.

In order the get information on how fast a proposed chemical process is
I turn to quantum chemistry. By doing ab initio modelling of small molecular
models you can get energetics of a reaction accurate enough to predict
kinetic parameters.

The software that I write are publicly available on `github <http://github.com/bjodah>`_.
The reason for why I publish my work there is twofold:

- It facilitates reproducibile research
- Other scientists are may use and improve upon my software.
